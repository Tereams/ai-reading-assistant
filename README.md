# ðŸ“š AI Reading Assistant

An autonomous AI agent that helps you form a daily reading habit by generating reading plans, extracting key questions and summaries from books, and evaluating your reflections â€” all fully automated with no manual intervention required.

---

## What It Does

**AI Reading Assistant** helps users stay consistent with their reading goals through automation and AI guidance.

It supports:

- Uploading PDF books with automatic cover and metadata generation
- Creating structured reading plans distributed over a desired number of days
- Sending morning and evening email reminders (autonomously scheduled)
- Using LLM to extract summaries and reflection questions from daily reading
- Evaluating user's written answers and recommending whether to advance
- Tracking daily progress and updating plans intelligently

> This agent is fully autonomous â€” it schedules itself, performs daily tasks, and adapts without human intervention.
